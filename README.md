# Communicate-data-findings
Project 3 from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - communicate data findings of the Bike Sharing System in S.Francisco 

## Overview of the dataset:

This dataset collects data from the S.Francisco Bay Area bike-sharing system rides. The data referes to February 2019 and has information about the users, like age, the start and end point of each rental and the initial and final station where the bikes were rented.


## Summary of Findings

The bike sharing system is by far, more used by men on their 30's, than women or other gender. Men travells shorter trips (in average).

Most of the users are subscribers, who travell at labour days and in the peak hours: 8am-9am and 17pm-18pm.

Customers, differently of subscribers, travell more at the weekends, for leisure purpose. They travell longer times and distances then subscribers and the peak hours is more spread.

The average age of the members is 34 years old.

I didn't find any linear relationship between age and distance or duration of the trip.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I found that customers and subscribers use the system differently. Subscribers use it mostly on labour days (rush hours: 8-9am and 17-18pm) while customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon.
